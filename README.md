- 👋 Hi hey and hello, I’m Alex or @Xandriane!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (of course), cyber security or privacy, and overall just vibing through the internet
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ in class, however, I have been learning about quantum computing on my off time
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that need to be debugged or have comments. 
-     I can also code whatever is needed, but I mainly feel confident in finding mistakes 
      and comprehending what the code does
- 📫 How to reach me: 
-     Discord - xandriane#1722
